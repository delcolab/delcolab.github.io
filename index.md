# The Delco Lab  
### Comparative Orthopedics & Mitochondrial Biology

**Advancing mitochondrial mechanobiology to fuel innovation in orthoregenerative medicine.**

We are a translational research group at Cornell University focused on how **mitochondrial function** and **mechanical loading** interact to shape **joint health and disease** across species.  
Our work spans **equine, murine, and human models** to understand and ultimately prevent **post-traumatic osteoarthritis** and related orthopedic disorders.

## Research Focus

- **Mitochondrial mechanobiology in cartilage and joint tissues**  
- **Comparative orthopedics**: leveraging large animal and rodent models  
- **Post-traumatic osteoarthritis after joint injury**  
- **Orthoregenerative strategies** targeting mitochondrial pathways

## Join the Lab

We welcome **students, residents, fellows, and postdocs** excited about joint biology, mitochondria, and translational orthopedic research.
